    <P>Aurora, also known as Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose,is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Productions' 16th animated feature film Sleeping Beauty (1959). Originally voiced by singer Mary Costa, Aurora is the only child of King Stefan and Queen Leah. An evil fairy named Maleficent seeks revenge for not being invited to Aurora's christening and curses the newborn princess, foretelling that she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her sixteenth birthday. Merryweather, one of the three good fairies, weakened the curse so Aurora would only sleep. Determined to prevent this, three good fairies raise Aurora as a peasant in order to protect her, patiently awaiting her sixteenth birthday — the day the spell can only be broken by a kiss from her true love, Prince Phillip.

        Aurora is based on the princess in Charles Perrault's fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty", as well as the heroine who appears in the Brothers Grimm's retelling of the story, "Little Briar Rose". For several years, Walt Disney had struggled to find a suitable actress to voice the princess and nearly abandoned the film entirely until Costa was discovered by composer Walter Schumann. However, Costa's southern accent nearly cost her the role until she proved that she could sustain a British accent for the duration of the film. In order to accommodate the film's unprecedentedly detailed backgrounds, Aurora's refined design demanded more effort than had ever been spent on an animated character before, with the animators drawing inspiration from Art Nouveau. Animated by Marc Davis, Aurora's slender physique was inspired by actress Audrey Hepburn. With only 18 lines of dialogue and equally few minutes of screen time, the character speaks less than any speaking main character in a feature-length Disney animated film.
        
        When Sleeping Beauty was first released in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for three decades. Aurora herself received negative reviews from both film and feminist critics for her passivity and similarities to Snow White, and would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaid's Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Actress Elle Fanning portrayed a live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of the 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of the title character. Fanning returned to portray Aurora in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019), which is set five years later.Aurora's parents name her after the Roman goddess of the dawn because she fills their lives with the radiant sunshine. Soon after she is born, she is presented to the kingdom at a christening, where she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of King Stefan's good friend King Hubert. Also invited are the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who bestow blessings on the newborn princess. Flora and Fauna give the infant princess the gifts of great beauty and song, respectively. However, before Merryweather has the opportunity to give her gift, the evil fairy Maleficent arrives. Angered because she isn't invited to the ceremony, Maleficent puts a curse on baby Aurora. According to Maleficent, before the sun sets on Aurora's sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. Maleficent disappears, leaving everyone in shock and horror at Aurora's doomed future. Though unable to lift the curse, Merryweather is able to soften it. Instead of death, she would alter the situation by placing Aurora into an enchanted sleep, which is the fateful prophecy she'll keep, only to be awakened by true love's kiss if this is to happen.</P>

Still fearful for the princess' safety, the three good fairies agree to hide the princess as a peasant for 16 years, until the danger has passed. They take the baby to a cottage in the forest and raise her, disguising themselves as her mortal aunts and renaming her Briar Rose. On Aurora's sixteenth birthday, her "aunts" send her out into the forest to pick berries, so that they can prepare her birthday party in secret. While Aurora is out, she has a conversation with her animal friends and dreams of meeting a handsome prince, as she is singing "Once Upon a Dream". At first, she is singing to her forest friends. But she soon meets Prince Phillip, who has followed her melodic voice. Not knowing who Phillip is, or of their betrothal, she at first believes him to be a stranger and attempts to leave. However, she dances with him for a bit and ends up falling in love. When he asks for her name, she then leaves, due to realizing she isn't allowed to give her name to strangers. She does, however, tell him where she lives and asks him to meet her there that night.Meanwhile, Briar Rose comes home to a splendid birthday party. She tells her aunts about the young man that she met, but gets confused when they are not happy for her. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather reveal Briar Rose's true identity as Princess Aurora, as well as the fact that she has been betrothed. The fairies sadly explain that she can never see the young man again, not knowing that he was actually her betrothed. Heartbroken, Aurora breaks into tears as she heads upstairs to weep on her bed. She doesn't speak again for the rest of the film (even her love interest Phillip does the same thing). The fairies bring the brokenhearted Aurora back to her father's castle, but in disguise with a hood and cloak to avoid anyone seeing her until the proper time. Before she can see her parents, they take her to a room where they conjure a crown and place it on her head to help her realize her royal identity. However, a heartbroken Aurora begins to cry and the fairies decide to leave her alone to grieve. While they are gone, Maleficent places the princess in a trance and leads her up an abandoned tower staircase. Just then, at the top floor of the empty room, Maleficent conjures a spinning wheel. The fairies realize that Aurora's in trouble due to their mistake of leaving her alone and frantically run up the stairs to stop her, but before they can, Maleficent forces the girl to prick her finger on the spindle, invoking the curse. When the fairies arrive too late to find Aurora, Maleficent mocks them for their failed efforts of trying to stop her by revealing the sleeping princess before vanishing, cackling maniacally in triumph.isappointed about their failure, the fairies place Aurora, now in an enchanted slumber, upon a bed at the top of the highest tower. Knowing that everyone would be heartbroken and disappointed if they had discovered this news, the fairies decide to put everyone to sleep until Aurora awakens. While putting all the residents in the kingdom to sleep, the fairies discover that Phillip has been the man that Aurora met all along after overhearing King Hubert speak of his son meeting a peasant girl before he falls asleep with everyone else. So the fairies go to the cottage to get Phillip, but are then prompted to go to the Forbidden Mountain, Maleficent's domain, after discovering that Maleficent has captured and imprisoned the prince. They rescue Phillip from the dungeon and arm him with the Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. After fending off Maleficent's minions, they finally exit the Forbidden Mountain just in time and head for Stefan's castle. Just then, Maleficent tries to prevent Phillip from doing so by assaulting him with her magic in various ways, culminating it by creating a forest of thorns in front of the castle, though Phillip manages to hack through the thorns with little effort. Angered at this, Maleficent suddenly appears in their way and transforms herself into a dragon. After defeating Maleficent in her dragon form with some help from the fairies, Phillip enters the castle and walks up the staircase to the tower room, where Aurora is still sleeping. He gives her a kiss, true love's kiss, which finally awakens Aurora and breaks the curse. Aurora smiles after she realizes that her betrothed and her love are the same person. Thanks to Phillip, all the royals in the kingdom also awaken from their indefinite sleeping curse.

The couple goes down to the ballroom to meet Aurora's parents and Phillip's father, who are also freed from the sleeping curse by Phillip’s true love on Aurora. She reunites and hugs her parents to embrace them, and kisses Hubert on his cheek before sharing a dance with Phillip. While the couple dances, Merryweather and Flora reignite their rivalry once again on their respective colors as the two bickering fairies relentlessly change the color on her dress with their magic. Aurora's ball gown keeps changing colors as she and Phillip continue dancing and share another kiss, with the final words in the book, below the illustration of the couple romantically kissing (and the color of Aurora's ball gown still changing between blue and pink) "and they lived happily ever after".</P>
        <h1><i>DEVELOPMENT</i></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Filmmaker Walt Disney had long been struggling to adapt the fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty" into a full-length animated film for several years, intending to base the project on both Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm's versions of the story.[4] Disney was considering abandoning work on the film altogether until singer Mary Costa was discovered, the casting of whom as the film's heroine finally allowed the project to graduate from development to production.[5] At the time Aurora was conceived, there had only been two prior Disney princesses: Snow White and Cinderella, the heroines of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950), respectively.[5] Disney wanted his third princess to be as different from Snow White as possible,[6] but several strong similarities remain between the two characters and their respective stories.[7] Gary Susman of Moviefone observed that both films feature "an evil witch jealous of a young and beautiful princess, the princess hiding out in a woodland cottage with a group of comic-relief caretakers ... and the witch putting the princess into a deathlike sleep, from which only true love's kiss can awaken her."[8]

        In the original fairy tale, the princess actually sleeps for 100 years before she is finally awakened by the prince's kiss; this detail was adjusted for the film in favor of having Prince Phillip introduced earlier, and thus Aurora is awakened much sooner.[7] In the Grimm version, the princess is destined to prick her finger at the age of 15, while Disney decided to age the character by one year.[9] Aurora's names are borrowed from both Tchaikovsky's ballet and the Grimm fairy tale. While Tchaikovsky referred to his princess as "Aurora", the Brothers Grimm had named her "Little Briar Rose";[10] this ultimately inspired Disney to use both names in the film,[11] the latter of which serves as the character's alias while she is hiding from Maleficent.[8] Aurora was the last princess in whose conception Walt Disney himself was directly involved prior to his death.</p>

height="200px" width="200px"><P>Princess Aurora appears in the story, "Keys to the Kingdom". In the story, Prince Phillip, King Hubert, King Stefan, and Queen Leah go off for a Royal Conference for two days. During this time, with the advice and help of Stefan's majordomo, Lord Duke, Princess Aurora is in charge of the Kingdom until they return. Throughout the segment, Aurora attempts to rely on staying calm during hectic situations, but this proves to be a challenge. Later on, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather leave the castle to return Hubert's forgotten speech. Before she left, Merryweather allowed Aurora to use her magic wand during harsh times and Duke reminded Aurora that they have too much work for the kingdom. Aurora initially thought of this as an easy way to avoid a hassle, ignoring her original vow to stay calm. Soon enough, the magic causes more trouble than before, having her result to her previous plans which prevail. Aurora succeeds and when her parents, Hubert, Phillip, the Good Fairies, and Duke (who was headbutted by a cow that sends him out of the castle) return, they then enjoy a banquet she prepared. It was implied in this story that Aurora's favorite color was pink seeing how she only wore her pink ball gown for this entire story, and she changed the color of her nightgown pink right before she went to bed.

            Mary Costa, the original voice of Aurora, was not fond of this story and felt that it did not work.</P>
